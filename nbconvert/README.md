# Jupyter Notebook convert helper for hugo

Converts the notebooks using `nbconvert` to `html` and puts the content into a Markdown file for Hugo.

Reads notebooks from `content/notebooks` and outputs it to `content/blog/generated-nbs`.

It uses [`mkdocs-jupyter`](https://github.com/danielfrg/mkdocs-jupyter).
