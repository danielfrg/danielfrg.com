      "This post describes a simple yet flexible implementation on how to deploy an [IPython.parallel](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/parallel/) cluster in multiple EC2 instances using [salt](http://www.saltstack.com/) and a little bit of [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/). The final output will be one instance running the IPython notebook, ipcontroller and acting as the salt-master, also 6 instances each one running ipengine and being salt-minions, see the [IPython.parallel docs](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/parallel/) for information on those commands.\n",

      "\n",
      "Let me begin saying that I know about [starcluster](http://star.mit.edu/cluster/) I have used it (for this same task) and I believe is the best way to create cluster for doing parallel computing but it lacks of a few features:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Only EC2 support: I use EC2 and a couple of AWS services everyday but what if I want to move to rackspace or any other cloud? So instead of reling on boto I use [salt-cloud](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/cloud/) that relies on [apache libcloud](https://libcloud.apache.org/)\n",
      "2. Dependency of installing the scientific libraries from pypi: I use anaconda on my mac and I wanted to use the same versions on the cloud, using the [salt state I wrote previously](http://danielfrg.com/blog/2013/11/27/ipython-notebook-aws-salt/) this was an easy task. With this having the latest version is as simple as changing the `requirements.txt`\n",
      "3. Plugins are python classes (see the [starcluster ipython plugin for example](https://github.com/jtriley/StarCluster/blob/develop/starcluster/plugins/ipcluster.py)): While this is completly fine once you learn configuration management you dont want to come back, a salt state is much more easier to create and mantain\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why not hadoop?** Again, I use hadoop every week, but for me it seams more natural to do the analysis on your tool of choice (python or R) and then scale it using the same (or similar) tool, it doesn't make a lot of sense to do the analysis on a tool just becuase it scales if it lacks the capabilityes you need, for example the excelente interactivity of IPython."

      "1. [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) (+[aws-plugin](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws)) to create the an EC2 instance that runs the ipython notebook. Note you could on run this on Rackspace by using [vagrant-rackspace](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-rackspace)\n",
      "2. `git clone` the [datasciencebox](https://github.com/danielfrg/datasciencebox) repo\n",
      "3. AWS account credentials\n",
      "4. Copy your EC2 keypair in the root of the repo of step 2 and name it `ipcluster.pem`, this is so Vagrant can copy the keypair to the cloud\n",
      "\n",
      "###Let's get started\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `cd` to that directory open the `Vagrantfile` and fill the values inside `config.vm.provider`, mainly the AWS credentials.\n",
      "2. `vagrant up --provider=aws`\n",

      "\n",
      "Start the `ipcontroller` by running the `ipcluster` salt state, you need to add a couple of values, mainly the aws and ec2 instances settings:\n",

      "\n",
      "Now you need to create the instances that are going to run the `ipengine`: `sudo salt-cloud -p base_ec2 ipython-minion-X` where `X` can be a number or string, i ran it with 1 and 2 for this example. This command will create the new instances, install the `salt-minion` and connect it to the `salt-master`.\n",
