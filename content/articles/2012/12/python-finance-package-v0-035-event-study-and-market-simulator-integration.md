Ok, here come the first "Real Life" example. As I mention on previous
posts my finance knowledge is mostly null so I cannot say this can be
used on real life but what I found playing with the utils I have created
is very interesting.

If anyone use this techniques and win/lose money I would love to hear :P
Also if anyone find discrepancies on the results **please** tell me.

Changes since last time
-----------------------

1.  <span style="line-height:13px;">Bug Fixes on Multiple Event Study:
    Missing values are now filled: forward and then backwards.</span>
2.  Multiple Event Studies: Graph with error bars (std)
3.  Integration between the Event Study Finder and Market Simulator

Example
-------

1.  Use the S&P 500 symbols from 2012
2.  Look in all 2011 for events when the value of the stock went below
    $5
3.  Discover how to use this opportunity to invest on the equities
4.  Simulate if we would make some money from that

### 1. Setup

In [1]: Imports

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime
from finance.utils import BasicUtils
from finance.utils import FileManager
from finance.utils import ListUtils
from finance.evtstudy import EventFinder
from finance.evtstudy import MultipleEvents
from finance.sim import MarketSimulator
```

In [2]: Download all the information on 2011 of all S&P 500 equities on
2012

```python
SP500_2012 = ListUtils.SP500(year=2012)
fm = FileManager()
start = datetime(2011,1,1)
end = datetime(2011,12,31)
files = fm.get_data(SP500_2012, start, end)
len(files)
```

Out [2]:

    498

### 2. Event: Went Below 5 - One event per Equity

In [5]: Look for events

```python
evtf = EventFinder()
evtf.symbols = SP500_2012
evtf.start_date = start
evtf.end_date = end
evtf.function = evtf.went_below(5)
evtf.search()
```

In [6]:

```python
evtf.num_events
```

Out [6]: 5 Events where found

    5

In [7]: Analyse the 5 Events

```python
mevt = MultipleEvents()
mevt.list = evtf.list
mevt.market = 'SPY'
mevt.lookback_days = 20
mevt.lookforward_days = 20
mevt.estimation_period = 250
mevt.run()
```

In [8]: Graph the mean cumulative abnornal return

```python
mevt.mean_cumulative_abnormal_return.plot()
```

![Mean Cumulative Abnormal Return](/images/blog/2012/12/finance035/mean_car.png "Mean Cumulative Abnormal Return")

The graph tell us that in average after the event (day 0) the return
goes up, but what about the risk?

In [9]: Print the Cumulative Abnormal Return with Error Bars

```python
mevt.plot('car')
```

![Mean Cumulative Abnormal Return with error bars](/images/blog/2012/12/finance035/mean_car_error_bars.png "Mean Cumulative Abnormal Return with error bars")

Ok, the graph tell us that the risk is going up as the time passes, this
was expected.
Since we are looking the data in 2011 we can see what happen in
reality.

We use the market simulator but we create the orders from the event
list.
The instructions are:

1.  On the event day: Buy 100 shares
2.  20 days after the event: Sell the 100 Shares
3.  Initial cash = $1000

In [10]: Use the market simulator

```python
sim = MarketSimulator('./data')
sim.field = &quot;Adj Close&quot;
sim.initial_cash = 1000
sim.create_trades_from_event(evtf.list, eventDayAction='Buy',
eventDayShares=100, actionAfter='Sell', daysAfter=20, sharesAfter=100)
sim.simulate()
sim.trades
```

Out [10]: This are the trades generated by the Simulator

    symbol action  num_of_shares
    2011-08-08   HBAN    Buy     100
    2011-09-06   HBAN    Sell    100
    2011-09-22   GNW     Buy     100
    2011-10-03   AMD     Buy     100
    2011-10-20   GNW     Sell    100
    2011-10-31   AMD     Sell    100
    2011-11-23   HCBK    Buy     100
    2011-12-19   BAC     Buy     100
    2011-12-22   HCBK    Sell    100
    2012-01-19   BAC     Sell    100

In [11]: Graph of the portfolio value:

```python
sim.portfolio.plot()
BasicUtils.total_return(sim.portfolio)
```

Out [11]:

    0.501

I obtain 5 events and a total return of 0.501 with just 10 trades.

![Portfolio value for the events](/images/blog/2012/12/finance035/mean_car.png "Portfolio value for the events")

### 3. Event: Went below 5 - more than one event per equity

From what I saw on the events when one event occurred more events
occurred soon (less than 20 days later), that didn't look good for me
that's why I tried first with no repeating events. But from my
[computational investing][] course I notice that they use all the events
so I tried that to: The code is the same just change this on the event
finder:

```python
evtf.search(oneEventPerEquity=False)
```

On this case I found 21 events with a total return of: 0.684; chart:

Conlusion
---------

Also if anyone find discrepancies on the results **please** tell me.

First, I obtain a total return of 0.501 with just 10 trades; that means
that the final value of the portfolio was $1,501. When I saw this I was
amazed, just buying shares of very cheap stocks (100 stocks @ <$5 =
500) and then selling those stocks 20 days later was possible to make
$501 in just 6 months. Even more if use the second event study.

Second, the utils works very well together and with a considerable
amount of data, not just 2 equities as before.

Third, **I am rich! weee!** Ok no, not really. But the results are
**very** interesting, at least I was amazed, I never believe of finding
a return greater than 0.5.

The code + the complete example is on GitHub: [PythonFinance][]

This is **far** from the end but the [computational investing][] course
ends with this example so I have no longer a source of inspiration, I am
searching for book on quantitative finance to keep learning and
developing the package.
