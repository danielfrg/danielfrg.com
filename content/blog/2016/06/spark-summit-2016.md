I was lucky enough to go San Francisco in June to  give a talk at Spark Summit 2016.
It was my first time in San Francisco and Silicon Valley I have to say it is a unique place.

My talk at Spark Summit covered a variety of topics around spark, python, python libraries, the deployment, use cases
and a little bit about alternatives and the future.

Below you can find the [video of the presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niTAJYCEAUM) and [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/SparkSummit/connecting-python-to-the-spark-ecosystem?qid=3679b512-22f3-4e7d-b1d0-dd689eec63f9&v=&b=&from_search=1).
