I was lucky enough to go San Francisco in June to  give a talk at Spark Summit 2016.
It was my first time in San Francisco and Silicon Valley I have to say it is a unique place.

My talk at Spark Summit covered a variety of topics around spark, python, python libraries, the deployment, use cases
and a little bit about alternatives and the future.
