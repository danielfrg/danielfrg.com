I had the luck to go to beautiful NYC in the fall to give a talk at PyData NYC 2015.

The talk was about how to query around 1.6 billion reddit comments with python tools while leveraging
some big data tools like Impala and Hive.

Some of the content can be found in the [continuum developer blog](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/querying-17-billion-reddit-comments-anaconda-platform)
