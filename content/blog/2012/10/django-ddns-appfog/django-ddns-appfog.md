I love web-apps as the data is always in sync magically via the cloud, but
sometimes I just need to access my computer via remote access to use
some app, get some file or just to start downloading some torrents(shh).
Remember/Email/Evernote
a changing
<abbr style="text-align:justify;" title="Wide area network IP">WAN
IP</abbr> is tedious that is were a
<abbr style="text-align:justify;" title="Dynamic Domain Name System">DDNS</abbr>
comes in. My previous and old Belkin router had a bunch of options for
<abbr style="text-align:justify;" title="Dynamic Domain Name System">DDNS</abbr>s
fortunately one was free; unfortunately
and unbelievable my new [Belkin N750 DB router][] has only one option:
[Dyn][] which is not free :(

So I decide to make my own
<abbr title="Dynamic Domain Name System">DDNS</abbr> with [Django][] and
with a free <abbr title="Platform as a Service">PaaS</abbr>.
<!--more-->
The first decision was to select a
<abbr title="Platform as a Service">PaaS</abbr> and there are a lot of
option currently; the list got narrowed because I needed a
free <abbr title="Platform as a Service">PaaS</abbr> for such a simple
and small app that it is just for me. Some options were: [OpenShift][]
from Red Hat, [dotCloud][] which looks pretty good but not so simple to
use and never understand if is really free or not, and other thousand
options that are paid and free. I choose [AppFog][] because I recently
read that they acquire Nodster (which I loved) and the service is **so
simple** to use, just what I needed for this project.

The project consist on two parts; The first one is a Django server which
stores previous IPs and acts as the DDNS domain and the second one is a
python script that get the WAN IP and request the server to store it.

1. Django Server on AppFog
--------------------------

Create the app on AppFog (2 clicks via its web app), download the code
via its <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> ([help][]) and
create a new Django app called *ddns*.

**NOTE**: AppFog
currently runs Django 1.3.1 (current version is 1.4) be sure to look at
the correct [tutorial/docs][] on their site.

### 1.1 Create Django users on AppFog

Since it is not possible to do an SSH connection on AppFog (to run
commands from the terminal to create the users to access the admin web
interface; wow 3 to's on a single phrase that needs to be some kind of
record) the simplest solution I could find was to create the with a view
and then access it  with a URL to create the user, and then change the
password ;)

```python
def createuser(request):
  if authenticate(username='daniel', password='pass') is not None:
    return HttpResponse("User already created ;)")
  try:
    user = User.objects.create_user('daniel', 'daniel@ctrl68.com',
    'pass')
    user.is_staff = True
    user.is_superuser = True
    user.save()
    return HttpResponse("User created! :)")
  except:
    print sys.exc_info()[0]
    return HttpResponse("Couldnt\\' create user :(")
```

### 1.2 Models

Just one model to store the IPs by date:

```python
class IP(models.Model):
  IP = models.CharField(max_length=15)
  date = models.DateTimeField('date')

  def __unicode__(self):
    return u'%s @ %s' % (self.IP, self.date.ctime())

  class Meta:
    get_latest_by = "date"
```

### 1.3 Other Views

index which does nothing, one to add new IP addresses available via POST
or GET requests, and one to redirect to the latest IP.

```python
def index(request):
  template = loader.get_template('index.html')
  context = Context({
  'var': 0,
  })
  return HttpResponse(template.render(context))

def addip(request):
  ip_txt = ""
  if request.method == 'GET':
    ip_txt = request.GET.get('ip')
  elif request.method == 'POST':
    ip_txt = request.POST.get('ip')

  try:
    if ip_txt != "" and ip_txt != None:
      ip = IP(IP=ip_txt, date=datetime.datetime.now())
      ip.save()
      ans = "IP %s added." % ip_txt
      return HttpResponse(ans)
    else:
      return HttpResponse("No IP.")
  except:
    return HttpResponse("Couldnt add %s to db." % ip_txt)

def redirect(request):
  ip = IP.objects.latest('date')
  return HttpResponseRedirect(str("http://%s" % ip.IP))
```

### 1.4 Fix Django Admin on AppFog

The Django Admin on AppFog doesn't load the CSS from static files
correctly I found a solution that is probably not the best but for such
a small project, well it is OK. On the main urls.py:

```python
from django.contrib.staticfiles.urls import staticfiles_urlpatterns
urlpatterns += staticfiles_urlpatterns()
```

2. Python Script
----------------

The other part is a python script which reads [this][] page; a nice page
that the people of [whatismyip.com][] create to help automation
processes like this one.

It makes a GET request to the Django app and also saves a file on
[Dropbox][] (before this I was using Dropbox as a temporally solution).
All inside a while True with a sleep of 10 minutes.

## Conclusion

Thats it! Now I can access my PC from daniel-pc.aws.af.cm - no DDoS please :P
I want to look more other PaaS solutions, mainly OpenShift, more coming soon.
