These are notes that I have taken while watching videos about tech, conferences or whatever really.

I started to take this notes when I finally got frustrated about watching so many tech videos
but not really remembering stuff when people asked me and having to go back to videos is annoying since
they are not very searchable. So this is an attempt to have a reference for stuff I have learned so I can
come here quicker than in a video.
